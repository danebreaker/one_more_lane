# One More Lane: Idle Highway Webgame

## Overview

One More Lane is an idle/incremental webgame inspired by the "one more lane" meme, which humorously suggests that adding more lanes to highways will solve traffic congestion. In this game, you manage a growing highway system, add lanes, and optimize traffic flow to maximize your score.

## Gameplay

- **Start with a single-lane highway** and a trickle of cars.
- **Earn points** as cars successfully travel down your highway.
- **Add more lanes** to increase capacity and reduce congestion.
- **Upgrade infrastructure** (e.g., traffic lights, overpasses) to further boost efficiency.
- **Face challenges** like traffic jams, accidents, and diminishing returns from endless expansion.
- **Prestige system**: Reset progress for permanent bonuses and new features.
